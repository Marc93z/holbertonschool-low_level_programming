A function in C is a block of organized reusuable code that is performs a single related action. Every C program has at least one function, which is main(), and all the most trivial programs can define additional functions.

When the algorithm of a certain problem involves long and complex logic, it is broken into smaller, independent and reusable blocks. These small blocks of code are known by different names in different programming languages such as a module, a subroutine, a function or a method.
